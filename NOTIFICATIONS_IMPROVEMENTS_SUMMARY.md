## Technical Implementation

### SQL Query Structure
```sql
SELECT n.*, p.title as problem_title
FROM notifications n
LEFT JOIN problems p ON n.problem_id = p.id
WHERE n.user_id = ? 
  AND n.type = ?           -- Optional: if type filter applied
  AND n.is_read = 0        -- Optional: if status filter applied
  AND (n.title LIKE ? OR n.message LIKE ? OR p.title LIKE ?)  -- Optional: if search query
ORDER BY n.created_at DESC
LIMIT 200
```

### Flash Message System
```php
// Set flash message
$_SESSION['flash_message'] = 'All notifications marked as read.';
$_SESSION['flash_type'] = 'success';
header('Location: notifications.php');
exit;

// Display flash message
if (isset($_SESSION['flash_message'])) {
    $message = $_SESSION['flash_message'];
    $message_type = $_SESSION['flash_type'];
    unset($_SESSION['flash_message']);
    unset($_SESSION['flash_type']);
}
```

### Mark All Read Implementation

#### Admin, ANMS, Villager (GET Request)
```php
if (isset($_GET['action']) && $_GET['action'] === 'mark_all_read') {
    $stmt = $pdo->prepare("UPDATE notifications SET is_read = 1 WHERE user_id = ? AND is_read = 0");
    $stmt->execute([$_SESSION['user_id']]);
    $_SESSION['flash_message'] = 'All notifications marked as read.';
    $_SESSION['flash_type'] = 'success';
    header('Location: notifications.php');
    exit;
}
```

#### Doctor (AJAX Request)
```javascript
function markAllRead() {
    if (!confirm('Mark all notifications as read?')) return;
    
    fetch('notifications.php', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'},
        body: 'action=mark_all_read'
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        if (data.success && data.reload) {
            location.reload();
        }
    });
}
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Query Optimization**
   - Added LIMIT 200 to prevent loading thousands of notifications
   - Used indexed columns (user_id, created_at) in WHERE and ORDER BY
   - Proper JOIN usage for related data

2. **Memory Management**
   - Limited result sets to 200 notifications
   - Efficient array filtering for statistics
   - Proper resource cleanup

3. **User Experience**
   - Fast page loads with limited datasets
   - Responsive search with parameterized queries
   - No unnecessary database calls

---

## Security Features

1. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - All queries use PDO prepared statements
   - Parameterized queries for all user inputs
   - No direct string concatenation in SQL

2. **XSS Protection**
   - All output uses `htmlspecialchars()`
   - Proper encoding with ENT_QUOTES and UTF-8
   - No raw user input displayed

3. **CSRF Protection**
   - Session-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

4. **Input Validation**
   - Type checking for filters
   - Trimming and sanitizing search queries
   - Proper integer casting for IDs
