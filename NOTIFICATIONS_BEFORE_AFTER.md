SELECT n.*, p.title as problem_title
FROM notifications n
LEFT JOIN problems p ON n.problem_id = p.id
WHERE n.user_id = ?
ORDER BY n.created_at DESC
```

```sql
-- Limited to 200, with proper filtering
SELECT n.*, p.title as problem_title
FROM notifications n
LEFT JOIN problems p ON n.problem_id = p.id
WHERE n.user_id = ?
  AND n.type = ?  -- Optional filter
  AND n.is_read = 0  -- Optional filter
  AND (n.title LIKE ? OR n.message LIKE ? OR p.title LIKE ?)  -- Optional search
ORDER BY n.created_at DESC
LIMIT 200

## 🔒 Security Enhancements

### Input Validation

#### BEFORE
```php
// Potential SQL injection risk
$type = $_GET['type'];
$query = "SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE type = '$type'";
```

#### AFTER
```php
// Parameterized query - SQL injection safe
$type = $_GET['type'] ?? '';
if ($type !== '') {
    $where[] = 'n.type = ?';
    $params[] = $type;
}
$stmt = $pdo->prepare($query);
$stmt->execute($params);
```

### Output Escaping

#### BEFORE
```php
// Potential XSS vulnerability
echo $notification['title'];
```

#### AFTER
```php
// XSS protection
echo htmlspecialchars($notification['title'], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
```
